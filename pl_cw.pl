% My Name here, My UserID  <--- so we know who you are
% F28PL Coursework, Prolog    <--- sanity check


% Due: Friday 6th of Dec, 2019, at 3:30pm sharp.
% Submit (this file) via GitLab as usual.
% This coursework constitutes 6% of your final F28PL mark.

% You may assume variables, procedures, and functions defined in earlier questions
% in your answers to later questions, though you should add comments in code explaining
% this if any clarification might help read your code.


/* For All Questions, include testing in comments, so your marker can load this file as a
database then cut-and-paste any testing into the command line.

Testing on GitLab will NOT be provided for prolog. Your own test will in this case be
 marked - note this is unlike the python coursework.

% Question 1   <--- Yes, so we know what question you think you're answering
%
% The complex numbers are explained here (and elsewhere):
%  http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/complex-number-multiply.html
% Represent a complex integer as a two-element list of integers, so [4,5] represents 4+5i.
% Write Prolog predicates
%  cadd/3
%  cmult/3
% representing complex integer addition and multiplication. Thus for instance,
%  cadd([X1,X2],[Y1,Y2],[Z1,Z2])
% succeeds if and only if Z1=X1+Y1 and Z2=X2+Y2.
% Note that complex number multiplication is not just like complex number addition.
% Check the link and read the definition.
%
%   <--- always have the question under your nose

% Question 2
%
% An integer sequence is a list of integers. Write a Prolog predicate
%  seqadd/3
% such that seqadd(X,Y,Z) succeeds when X and Y are lists of integers of the same length and
% Z is their sequence sum.

% Question 3
%
% 4a. Explain what backtracking has to do with Prolog. You might find this webpage helpful:
% https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02gw/prolog_tutorial/prologpages/search.html
%
% 4b. What is Cut in prolog and what does it have to do with backtracking? Explain your answer by giving examples of Cut
% used in at least one prolog rule, and explain how it affects the execution/resolution process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Question 4
%
% Write a database for a predicate cycleoflife/1 such that the query
%  cycleoflife(X)
% returns the instantiations
%  X = eat
%  X = sleep
%  X = code
%  X = eat
%  X = sleep
%  X = code
%  ...
% in an endless cycle.
% (This question has a beautiful and simple answer. If you find yourself writing lines and lines of
% complex code, thereâ€™s probably something amiss.)
